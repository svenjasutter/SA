\chapter{Quality Measures}

\instructions{
    Describe the quality measures applied in your project as covered in the SEP1 and SEP2 modules. Things that might be included in this chapter:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Organizational means like \textit{Merge Requests}, \textit{Definition of Done}, etc.
        \item Tools used to assess the quality of your product (linter, metrics, ...)
        \item Tools used to build and deploy your product (CI/CD)
        \item The \textit{Test Strategy} used for testing your product as discussed in the SEP1 Module (how each functional and non-functional requirement is verified, at what level (Unit, Integration, System), etc.)
    \end{itemize}
    
    Try to avoid duplication with other chapters such as the \textit{Project Plan}. Work with cross-references when appropriate.
