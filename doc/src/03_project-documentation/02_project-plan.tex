\chapter{Project Plan}

Our project plan is structured to include weekly meetings every Thursday. In these meetings we review the current progress of the project and gain valuable insights from Dr Caracas. These meetings are marked in red on our schedule. In parallel with the progress of the project, we are committed to an ongoing documentation effort, which will be fully completed at the end of the project.
